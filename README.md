## ‚ÅâÔ∏è FAQ
Frequently Asked Questions!

### What did I sign up for? What did I get myself into?
Hopefully you're gonna learn how to use Itential‚Äôs products to execute network automations (scripts, ansible things and stuff), integrate APIs from systems like NetBox and ServiceNow (via our cool integration framework), and build orchestrated workflows to deliver services that make a real impact on how you operate and deliver your network infrastructure. The plan is to show you how to take your automation efforts from your laptop to the rest of the organization.

### What do I need to do in advance?
Read the FAQ (duh!, who wouldn't?).

You'll receive steps on how to set up your trial environment the week prior, so keep an eye out for that email from our team. Keep reading these FAQs for a sneak peek. 


### How do I access this thing?
Well, it depends on what you're talking about. There are two things that you will need to access:

* The Itential Platform: You'll receive access to set up your account in a how to email the week prior. (The email will come from noreply@itential.com, if you don't see it make sure to check your spam folder.)
* Itential Automation Gateway (from here on out referred to as IAG because, who doesn't love acronyms): If you're an eager beaver, you can go ahead and install this locally with this set up guide. Or you can wait until we grant you platform access the week prior. Your call. 

Don't worry we'll be harrassing you about getting signed up. 

### What is this Platform and this IAG thing?
The Itential Platform is the engine that allows you to build orchestrated workflows comprised of your scripts, API integrations and reusable assets, execute configuration management tasks like compliance, backups, etc. and build network products for your organization. Cool huh?!

IAG is the automation gateway used to execute python scripts, ansible playbooks and opentofu plans DIRECTLY FROM YOUR REPO!!! Sorry, got excited for a second. 

### Wait, do I really need to install IAG?
 In order to participate, IAG must be installed on your machine, plus you get to play with the software on your own after the workshop is over.

 It'll be kinda lame if you don't (more of a visual experience, than practical experience), but reach out to workshop@itential.com if you have some corporate restriction that won't let you. 

### What are the requirements for running IAG?
Good question. Nothing too crazy ‚Äî if your laptop can run Outlook, you're probably fine. It'll be a single binary inside a tar file. We're very cool like that.

You'll also need to be able to run CLI commands.

Here's what you'll need:

* **macOS, Windows WSL, or Linux** ‚Äî anything modern - if you have Linux, why are you reading this?
  
  _See, we're pretty flexible_

  AND

* Internet access (for talking to devices, cloning from repos and stuff) - hotel or event wifi _should_ be acceptable.

### Do I need admin rights on my laptop?
That's a complicated question. 

* **Windows** - If you have WSL setup when you should have sudoer access which will let you run the install package.
* **macOS** - If you have mac you need to be able to bypass and execute software from unidentified developers. <- the thing is not signed by the Apple AppStore. meh!
* **Linux** - You should be good, one would think.

### What if I break something?
Congrats, you're officially doing automation. üòÑ But seriously, no stress ‚Äî we can redo the setup at any time. Worst case, we will blow up your trial space and start over. 

### Will I keep access after the workshop?
Yes! You‚Äôll be able to keep using IAG locally, and your Itential Platform trial will be available for continued exploration after you sober up from all the beer, am I right?!.
